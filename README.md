## Discription
  Burger is a simple app designed as a test of skill with express handlebars, express, sequelize, and following MVC organization. The app works by using creating a list of burgers from a database that can be added to. Each of the burgers comes with a button to eat the burger if it is in the not eaten list and if it is on the already eaten list the button will alow you to make another. Clicking either of the buttons will update a boolean in the database for the burger and switch it between the two lists.
